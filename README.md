# wasteagram

(This project is the portfolio project for my Mobile Software Development class at Oregon State University).

An Instagram-like mobile app built for a fake client who is trying to prevent food waste at his small cafe in Portland, OR.

Wasteagram allows cafe employees to upload photos of food items and indicate how many of those items had been wasted. Over time, the cafe would be able to track the quantity of food items that are going to waste, and adjust the inventory as needed to minimize the amount of inventory that is being wasted.
